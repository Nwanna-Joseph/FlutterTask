### State Management :
üß† State Management Approach in This Project
In this project, we adopted the GetX state management solution to manage the app's logic, reactivity, and dependency injection in a clean, scalable, and testable way.

‚úÖ Why GetX?
We chose GetX for its simplicity, minimal boilerplate, and powerful integration of:

* State management

* Navigation

* Dependency injection

This helped us keep the codebase lean while still supporting advanced features like dynamic filtering, live task updates, and UI reactivity with minimal effort.

üîÅ Reactive State Management
We used GetX‚Äôs reactive programming model via .obs to automatically update the UI whenever task data changes.

Example:

```RxList<TaskItem> filteredAndSortedResults = <TaskItem>[].obs;```
This enables widgets to reactively rebuild using Obx():

```
Obx(() => ListView(
    children: controller.filteredAndSortedResults
        .map((task) => TaskCard(task))
        .toList(),
))
```

üì¶ Controller-Driven Architecture
Each feature screen (e.g., task list, add form) is powered by a dedicated TasksController, which:

* Handles all business logic like adding, editing, deleting tasks.

* Talks to the `TaskRepository` interface defined in the `domain` layer.

* Maintains all reactive state.

Example Responsibilities:
* `addTask()`: Adds a task via the repository and refreshes UI

* `sortAndFilter()`: Applies user-defined filtering/sorting rules

* `fetchTasksFromDevice()`: Loads and syncs tasks from local storage

This separation ensures that the UI remains dumb, and all logic stays inside the controller.

üß© Dependency Injection with GetX
Instead of manually wiring dependencies, we used Get.put() to inject and register instances like so:

```
Get.put<TaskRepository>(TaskRepositoryImpl());
Get.put(TasksController());
```
This allowed us to easily mock dependencies in tests using Get.replace() or Get.put(MockRepo()).

üß™ Testability Benefits
Thanks to this architecture:

* Controller tests can mock the repository to test logic in isolation.

* Widget tests use GetX keys and injected dependencies to simulate real interactions.

* Dialog and form tests are deterministic and repeatable.

### üß± Architecture Summary
This project follows a clean layered architecture divided into three main layers:

1. Presentation Layer
* Built with Flutter widgets and GetX controllers.

* Handles UI rendering and user interaction.

* Uses Obx() and .obs for reactive updates.

* Example: TasksController manages task state and UI actions.

2. Domain Layer
* Contains entities, use cases, and abstract repositories.

* Defines the business logic without knowing how or where data is stored.

* Example: TaskRepository defines methods like addTask() and getAllTasks().

3. Data Layer
* Implements domain contracts using FlutterSecureStorage.

* Handles JSON serialization, local persistence, and API interaction (if needed).

* Example: TaskRepositoryImpl reads/writes task data securely.

üß† Why This Matters:
* Separation of concerns = cleaner, testable, and scalable code.

* UI doesn‚Äôt depend on storage or business logic details.

* Easy to replace storage (e.g., switch to Firebase or SQLite) with zero UI changes.

### Beyond Requirements: 
Testing the APK on multiple devices using firebase Test Lab:
* I ran and tested the APK on firebase test lab. This allowed me to test on a variety of devices virtual and real devices
* I tested different device layouts, lifecycle changes, ANR, memory constraints and on slow devices.
* After running, the reports were sent to my email.
